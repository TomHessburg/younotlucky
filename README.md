# younotlucky

So I'm definitely not a statistics major or something, but every time that I watch a RuneScape video (an MMORPG that I've played since I was a kid), I cringe a bit when people get infurated for not recieving an item from a monster on drop rate. A drop chance of 1/128 does not mean that you're guaranteed that item in that many kills :D I wrote this little app to help RuneScape players see TRUELY how un-lucky they are for going SO DRY on that abyssal whip or that Armadyl Hilt. 

NPC and drop data was sourced from OSRSBOX, and since I didn;t source the data manually or from an actual OSRS API, the drop rates may be a bit outdated/innacurate. But from what I see, they certainly look pretty close :)
