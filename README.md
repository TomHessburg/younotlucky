# younotlucky

So I'm definitely not a statistice major or something, but every time that I watch a RuneScape vide (and MMORPG that I've played since I was a kid), I've cringed a bit when people got infurated for not recieving and item from a monster on drop rate. A drop chance of 1/128 does not mean that you're gerunteed that item in that many kills. I'm writing this simple little app to help RuneScape players see the TRUELY how un-lucky they are for going SO DRY on that abyssal whip or that Armadyl Hilt. 

NPC and drop data was sourced from OSRSBOX, and since I didnt source the data manually, the drop rates may be a bit outdated/innacurate. But from what I see, they certainly look pretty close :)
